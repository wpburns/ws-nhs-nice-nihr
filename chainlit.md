# NHS NICE NIHR RAG Demo

This demo demonstrates the capabilities of using LLMs (Large Language Models) to act as a chatbot inspired by the NHS 111 service, offers non-emergency health symptom checking.

## Data

Using the text of over **1,400** pages and documents from [NICE](https://patient.info/) & [NIHR](https://nihr.ac.uk/), a custom LLM Chatbot was developed to offer the healthcare professionals information in relation current treatment guidelines.

**This is an early stage proof-of-concept and should not be taken as official medical advice!**
